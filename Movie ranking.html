<h3>1. Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>One of the most unique and heart touching movies I have ever watched.</p>
<h3>2. Seven</h3>
<p>I just love these kind of movies which are thought provoking and thrilling at the same time. I just loved Bradd Pitt and 
   Morgan Freeman's duo.

<h3>3. The Pianist</h3>
<p>Truly a remarkable film. Shows you how beautiful and nasty we human beings can be. How circumstances can bring the 
    best and the worst in us.
</p>
<h3>4. 1917</h3>
<p>An incredible film that has left an indelible mark on me.</p>
<h3>5. Dead Poet's Society</h3>
<p>A movie that resonates with my ideals on so many levels. To stand against the the 
    current of orthodoxy and dogma and try to become our very own unique individual. I loved this film.
